# TianoForge: Automated Bug Triage Script for TianoCore EDK II

TianoForge is an integrated automated bug triage framework for the [TianoCore EDK II](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2) ecosystem. It unifies four key triage tasks — invalid issue detection, duplicate detection, priority prediction, and developer assignment — into a single sequential workflow powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), domain-specific prompt engineering, and hybrid retrieval (BGE + BM25 + RRF).

## Models Evaluated

Ten state-of-the-art LLMs are evaluated across all tasks:

| Provider | Models |
|---|---|
| OpenAI | `gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4.1-mini`, `gpt-4.1`, `gpt-5.4-mini`, `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.5` |
| Anthropic | `claude-haiku-4-5`, `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `claude-opus-4-7` |

---

## Selected Default Configuration (TianoForge)

| Task | Model |
|---|---|
| Invalid Detection | `claude-sonnet-4-6` |
| Duplicate Detection | `claude-sonnet-4-6` |
| Priority Prediction | `claude-sonnet-4-6` |
| Bug Assignment | `gpt-5.5` |

All other models and configurations remain available as a comment in the integerated notebook.

## Dataset

The experiments use a dataset of **2,610 closed EDK II bug issues** collected from the [TianoCore GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/issues) on April 3, 2026:

- **2,535 Bugzilla-transferred issues**
- **75 GitHub-native issues** — evaluation set (filed directly on GitHub, Dec 2024 – Feb 2026)
  - Priority distribution: 32 medium, 28 low, 15 high
  - 37 issues carry a known first assignee (used for assignment task and TianoForge evaluation)

The dataset is publicly available on Dataverse (link omitted for anonymous review). Place the CSV file at:
- Google Drive root, or
- Inside the task-specific Drive folder (see notebook Cell 2 for path details)

---

## Setup and Usage

All notebooks are designed to run on **Google Colab**.

### 1. Add API Keys to Colab Secrets

In Colab, go to **Secrets** (🔑 icon) and add:

| Secret name | Value |
|---|---|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Your OpenAI API key |
| `OPENAI_ORG_ID` | Your OpenAI organization ID (optional) |
| `OPENAI_PROJECT_ID` | Your OpenAI project ID (optional) |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Your Anthropic API key |

### 2. Upload the Dataset

Upload to your Google Drive root, or to the task-specific folder defined in Cell 2 of each notebook.

### 3. Run the Integrated Pipeline

Open `finalized-integrated-script/triage_integrated_script.ipynb` and run all cells top to bottom. The pipeline processes all 37 labeled issues sequentially across all four tasks and saves results to Google Drive under `triage_framework/results/`.

### 4. Run Individual Sub-Task Notebooks

Each notebook in `finalized_4_sub_tasks/` evaluates all 10 models under both System A and System B for a single triage task. Run cells top to bottom. Results are saved to the task-specific Drive folder.

## Dependencies

```
openai
anthropic
chromadb
sentence-transformers
rank_bm25
scikit-learn
pandas
tqdm
```

All dependencies are installed automatically in Cell 1 of each notebook via `pip install`.

## Key Results


The integrated TianoForge pipeline reduces average triage time from **10.86 days** (manual) to **7.08 minutes** (automated), a reduction of **99.95%** (~2,208× speedup).
